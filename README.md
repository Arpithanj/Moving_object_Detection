# 🕵️‍♀️ Moving Object Detection using OpenCV

This project detects moving objects in real-time using a webcam. It uses Python and OpenCV to compare consecutive video frames and identify motion by drawing bounding boxes around moving areas.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time motion detection
- Bounding box around detected movement
- Adjustable sensitivity

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

Install with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python

To run
python moving_object_detection.py
